# Raspberry Pi Zero Setup Guide - Step by Step Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up your Raspberry Pi Zero with a Waveshare e-ink display. Don't worry if you're not technical - we'll explain everything clearly!

## What You Need Before Starting

Make sure you have all these items ready:

- **Raspberry Pi Imager** (software you'll download)
- **SD card** (microSD card, 16GB or larger recommended)
- **Raspberry Pi Zero** (the small computer board)
- **Waveshare e-ink display 2.13 inch** (the screen)
- **Our provided config file** (you should have received this)
- **Our provided Raspberry Pi image file** (you should have received this)
- **SD card reader** (if your computer doesn't have a built-in SD card slot)
- **Power adapter** for the Raspberry Pi (micro USB)

## Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi Imager

First, you need to download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer:

1. Go to the official Raspberry Pi website
2. Download the Raspberry Pi Imager for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
3. Install the software by following the installation wizard
4. Once installed, open the Raspberry Pi Imager

## Step 2: Insert Your SD Card

Now you need to connect your SD card to your computer:

1. Take your microSD card
2. If your computer has a built-in SD card slot, insert the card directly
3. If your computer doesn't have an SD card slot, use an SD card reader:
   - Connect the SD card reader to a USB port on your computer
   - Insert the microSD card into the card reader
4. Your computer should recognize the SD card

## Step 3: Configure the Raspberry Pi Imager

Time to set up the imaging software:

1. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager (if not already open)
2. Click on "Choose Device" and select **Raspberry Pi Zero**

3. Click on "Choose OS"
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the list and select **"Use custom"**
5. Browse to find and select the **Raspberry Pi image file** we provided to you
6. The image will now be loaded into the imager

## Step 4: Select Your SD Card

1. Click on "Choose Storage"
2. Select your SD card from the list (be careful to choose the right one!)
3. Click "Next" to continue
4. When prompted, click **"Edit Settings"** (this is important!)

## Step 5: Configure Important Settings

These settings are crucial for your Raspberry Pi to work properly:

### Username Settings:
- **Username:** Make sure this is set to **"pi"** (this is very important!)
- **Password:** Choose a secure password you'll remember

### WiFi Settings:
- **Enable WiFi:** Check this box
- **Network name (SSID):** Enter your WiFi network name

- **Password:** Enter your WiFi password
- **WiFi country:** Select your country


### SSH Settings:
- **Enable SSH:** Check this box (this allows remote access to your Raspberry Pi)

### Save Your Settings:
1. Click "Save" to save all your settings
2. Click "Yes" to apply the settings
3. Click "Yes" again to confirm you want to write the image to the SD card

## Step 6: Write the Image to SD Card

This is where the magic happens:

1. The writing process will begin automatically
2. **This can take up to 30 minutes** - be patient and don't disconnect anything
3. You'll see a progress bar showing the writing and verification progress
4. When complete, you'll see a "Write Successful" message

## Step 7: Configure Your Config File
**Important**: Create a room in your Odoo module first (you will find the guide in our repository under "code")


Before removing the SD card, you need to add your custom configuration:

1. **Don't eject the SD card yet!**
2. Open the **autorun.conf file** we provided to you
3. Edit the following parameters in the config file (replace all "INPUT_YOUR_VALUES" with your actual information):
   - **rasp-name:** Enter the rasp ID generated by the room
  
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdfda668-00ea-4db3-ba45-9aa5c96f97d0" alt="settings_gif" width="400"/>
   - **broker:** Enter your MQTT broker IP address or hostname
   - **port:** Enter your MQTT broker port number (usually 1883 or 8883)
4. Save the edited config file
5. **Drag and drop** the edited config file onto the SD card
6. **Important:** A message will appear saying "A file named autorun.conf already exists" - click **"Replace"** to overwrite the existing file

7. Make sure the file has been copied successfully

## Step 8: Prepare Your Raspberry Pi

Now it's time to set up the hardware:

1. **Safely eject** the SD card from your computer
2. **Insert the SD card** into your Raspberry Pi Zero (the small slot on the board)
3. **Connect the Waveshare e-ink display** to your Raspberry Pi (follow any connection instructions that came with your display)

## Step 9: Power Up Your Raspberry Pi

Time for the moment of truth:

1. **Connect your Raspberry Pi** to a power source using the micro USB power adapter
2. The Raspberry Pi will start booting up
3. Wait for the **setup display** to appear on the e-ink screen

## Step 10: Troubleshooting

If the screen doesn't show the setup display:

1. **Disconnect the power** from your Raspberry Pi
2. **Wait 10 seconds**
3. **Reconnect the power** to restart the Raspberry Pi
4. The setup display should now appear

## You're Done!

Congratulations! Your Raspberry Pi Zero with e-ink display should now be running. The setup display indicates that everything is working correctly and your device is ready to use.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any problems:
- Double-check all connections
- Ensure your WiFi credentials are correct
- Make sure the config file was properly edited and copied
- Try the power cycle (disconnect and reconnect power) if the display isn't working

Remember, the most common issues are usually simple fixes like incorrect WiFi passwords or loose connections!

**Installation Complete**: Your Raspberry Pi Zero with e-ink display is now configured and ready for operation. The system will automatically connect to your MQTT broker and display relevant information on the e-Paper screen.
